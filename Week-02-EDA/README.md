# Housekeeping
1. Must do the [class survey](https://forms.gle/2guJsRgiLpwjARLQA) before leaving class.  That is how we are going to be taking attendance.  
2. If you're going to be absent, you must slack Silu Hu __and__ your TA.  If you are going to attend the other class instead of your own, slack that classes TA.  
	* Tuesday's TA == Tyron Samaroo
	* Friday's TA == Seth Marcus && Jon Chery

## Announcements
1. Always check [Silu's Weekly Updates](https://ctp2022.slack.com/archives/C03MWUDJM6V/p1661961436088019) on slack every Wed afternoon. (also, add emoji reaction to the slack message for us to know you've seen it.)
2. The bulk of the [Summer HW](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BA7U77SKa_SGC6OXG7OmC0xliWkmPEE3RnWVRWqJ4sE/edit) is due this Friday Sep 9th at 11:59pm. 

# Plan for today
1. Review last weeks homework.
2. Update Fork
3. Live coding lecture. 
4. Break.
5. Begin Exercise.

# Updating your fork


Every week, run these commands from your terminal when you're inside the 2022-fall-data-science folder.
1.  `git fetch upstream`
2.  `git merge upstream/main`

If it says you dont have an upstream, that means you didn't run the command from last class: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/CUNYTechPrep/2022-fall-data-science.git`

__!! If you get this error `merge: upstream/master not something we can merge` when trying to update your fork. Try running this command instead__
1. `git fetch upstream`
2. `git merge upstream/master`




# Homework
1. Complete the Exercise-EDA.ipynb and paste it into the HW submission sheet. 
2. Make your professional github website.  You don't have to fill it with content yet, but you must at least create it and paste the link into the HW submission sheet in the Personal Website column.

In addition to the `Exercise-EDA.ipynb` homework, you are also going to have to create your own [Github Pages resume website](https://zd123.github.io/zacks-template-site.github.io/).  Here are two tutorials on how to set it up.  [Tutorial Resource 1](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), and [Tutorial Resource 2](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).  It is optional to use a jekyll template, but recommended cause they are cool. 

Github pages use the [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) instead of HTML/CSS, so they are much easier to edit and maintain. 

Note, __you just have to set up your website__ this week.  Next week we will begin to fill it in.  


__Once you set it up, paste the link in the HW Submissions Sheet under the 'personal website' column.__
