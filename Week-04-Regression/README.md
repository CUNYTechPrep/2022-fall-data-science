# Homework! 
FIND A TEAM!!! Make a team (3 per team.  ie; 2 others and yourself).  This is in addition to the Exercise-Regression.ipynb.
* Use slack.  Post your ideas in the slack channel. 
*  Read others ideas in the slack channel.  
* Reach out to others.
* Worst comes to worst, make a random name selector and reach out to the first 2 random names it chooses. 

If you want more or less than 3 people on your team, construct a valid reasoning and slack it to me.  I will consider serious inquiries. No promises tho.
