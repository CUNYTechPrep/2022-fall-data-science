# Data Wrangling with Pandas

1. [Intro Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gj3BEf8XepJFnJWNU_gPGDrIQ6HcnZOsYeWjsCY8lXc/edit?usp=sharing)

2. Virtual Programming Expectations 
	1. Please be on time, appropriately dressed as you would be for an in-person class.

	2. When joining a virtual class/workshop, make sure to use your full name (including a prefered first name) to ensure ease of attendance and communication during class. Also, you can add your preferred pronouns. (ex: she/her/hers)

	3. When youâ€™re not speaking, keep yourself on mute.

	4. Be prepared to have your camera on! Being able to see all of our faces during class will help us all keep each other accountable for staying engaged, listening when others speak, and, most importantly, getting to know each other and build community.

	5. Stage your workspace! Do your best to have a quiet space ready for class each week, with appropriate lighting and background.

	6. Commit to fully participate in class. You are expected to not multitask, and be fully engaged in class. You can also expect us to give you a break after at least every 90 minutes of class! We commit to caring for one another and ourselves by staying healthy and charged. Learning from home is a new experience for many of us. We encourage you to use your breaks to stretch, use the bathroom, hydrate, get a snack, or just unplug.

	7. Always be respectful and courteous to other students, instructors, and guests during sessions. Inappropriate, offensive or threatening comments; misrepresentation of identity, and/or disruptive behavior by any participants during sessions will not be tolerated.
