# Building Web Apps with [Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io/) 

You need to install two new libraries...
* `pip install streamlit`
* `pip install pycaret`


# Materials
### [Link to app](https://zd123-streamlit-test-app-home-uq8qo8.streamlit.app/) that we will be reviewing in class.

### [Link to the github repo](https://github.com/zd123/streamlit-test-app) of that app. 

# Set up a virtual environment to test your app out locally.
Navigate to the folder you want to build your app in. Then run the following.  

**Very important...**, when you are adding these code files to your github repo, **do not add the env folder at all**.  This is for local use only and will only slow down everything. 

```
mkdir env

python3 -m venv env/

source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
